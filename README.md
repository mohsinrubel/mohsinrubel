Here is the short description of technology stacks i used:

**Git:** Git is a version control system that helps manage and track changes to your source code. In this project, Git serves as the central repository for your application's source code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate, contribute, and maintain version history.

**Jenkins:** Jenkins is an automation server that plays a crucial role in continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines. It automates the building, testing, and deployment of your application. In this project, Jenkins is used to:

Trigger automated builds whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository.
Execute unit tests and other quality checks.
Deploy the application to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

**SonarQube:** SonarQube is a static code analysis tool that helps maintain code quality and identify code smells, bugs, and vulnerabilities. In this project, 
`` SonarQube: ``
Analyzes the source code and identifies issues.
Provides reports and metrics on code quality.
Ensures that code adheres to coding standards and best practices.

**Docker:** Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your application and its dependencies into containers. In this project,
`` Docker: ``
Provides a consistent and isolated environment for running applications.
Ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
Simplifies deployment and scaling of the application.

**Nginx:** Nginx is a web server and reverse proxy server known for its performance and reliability. In this project, `` Nginx:`` Acts as a reverse proxy to route incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate Docker containers.Provides load balancing and security features.Serves as a front-end server for your web application.

## 🌱 I'm Currently Learning

I'm always eager to expand my skill set. Currently, I'm learning:

- [Terraform Module Base Architecture](https://github.com/mohsinrubel/terraform-module-template): Terraform modules serve as reusable building blocks in infrastructure as code (IaC) design. They encapsulate and abstract resources, configurations, and logic, enabling the creation of consistent and scalable infrastructure. Modules promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability by allowing the definition of custom resources with well-defined inputs and outputs. This modular approach simplifies complex infrastructure management, encourages best practices, and enhances collaboration among teams. By abstracting infrastructure components into modules, Terraform users can efficiently provision and manage cloud resources while reducing redundancy and errors in their IaC templates.
- [Learning Cybersecurity](link-to-resources):  Currently i practice  on TryHackme(https://tryhackme.com/). Reading "The Web Application Hacker's Handbook" by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto. Exploring ethical hacking techniques and tools, focusing on network security.
- [Blockchain Development and Web 3.0](): I'm currently diving into the exciting realm of Blockchain Development and Web 3.0. This includes understanding the foundational concepts of blockchain technology, **smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), nft,** and the potential of Web 3.0 to reshape the internet as we know it.
