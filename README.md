# Hi there, I'm  @mohsinrubel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate DevOps Engineer with a focus on automating and streamlining development and operations processes. My goal is to help teams deliver high-quality software faster by implementing efficient CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), and other DevOps best practices.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, AWS CloudFormation
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Jenkins, Bamboo, GitHub Actions, Gitlab
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible, Puppet, Chef
- **Cloud Platforms:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Scripting & Automation:** Bash, Python

## ðŸš€ My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Git-jenkins-SonarQube-Docker-Nginx](https://github.com/mohsinrubel/portfolio): A DevOps project that involves Git, Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, and Nginx typically focuses on automating the software development and deployment pipeline while ensuring code quality and security. Here's a brief description of each component's role in the project:

**Git:** Git is a version control system that helps manage and track changes to your source code. In this project, Git serves as the central repository for your application's source code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate, contribute, and maintain version history.

**Jenkins:** Jenkins is an automation server that plays a crucial role in continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines. It automates the building, testing, and deployment of your application. In this project, Jenkins is used to:

Trigger automated builds whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository.
Execute unit tests and other quality checks.
Deploy the application to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

**SonarQube:** SonarQube is a static code analysis tool that helps maintain code quality and identify code smells, bugs, and vulnerabilities. In this project, 
`` SonarQube: ``
Analyzes the source code and identifies issues.
Provides reports and metrics on code quality.
Ensures that code adheres to coding standards and best practices.

**Docker:** Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your application and its dependencies into containers. In this project,
`` Docker: ``
Provides a consistent and isolated environment for running applications.
Ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
Simplifies deployment and scaling of the application.

**Nginx:** Nginx is a web server and reverse proxy server known for its performance and reliability. In this project, `` Nginx:`` Acts as a reverse proxy to route incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate Docker containers.Provides load balancing and security features.Serves as a front-end server for your web application.

Overall, this DevOps project automates the entire software development lifecycle, from code commits in Git to building and testing in Jenkins, ensuring code quality with SonarQube, containerizing the application with Docker, and finally deploying it behind Nginx for production use. The result is a streamlined and efficient development and deployment process that maintains code quality and security while ensuring consistency across different environments.

- [Git-jenkins-SonarQube-Ansible-Docker-Haproxy](https://github.com/mohsinrubel/shop-ansible-pipeline): This DevOps project is designed to streamline and enhance the software development and deployment process. It leverages a combination of powerful tools and technologies:

**Git:** Facilitates collaborative development and version control, enabling teams to work on code collaboratively.

**Jenkins:** Automates the entire CI/CD pipeline, from code integration to deployment, ensuring rapid and reliable software delivery.

**Ansible:** Orchestrates and automates infrastructure provisioning and configuration management, reducing manual tasks and ensuring consistency across environments.

**SonarQube:** Focuses on code quality and security by conducting static code analysis and providing actionable insights to improve codebase health.

**Docker:** Utilizes containerization to package applications and dependencies consistently, ensuring seamless deployment across various environments.

HAProxy: Acts as a high-performance load balancer and reverse proxy, distributing incoming traffic to Docker containers for a resilient and scalable application architecture.

This DevOps project enables efficient collaboration, automated infrastructure management, code quality assessment, containerized deployments, and reliable traffic routing. It empowers development teams to deliver high-quality software swiftly while maintaining infrastructure reliability and scalability.
- [Git-Jenkins_SonarQube-AwsEcr-Git-ArgoCd-AwsEKs](link-to-repo): This DevOps project combines a powerful set of tools and cloud services to streamline and enhance the software development and deployment process:

**Git:** Enables collaborative development and version control, fostering team collaboration and efficient code management.

**Jenkins:** Orchestrates continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, automating build, test, and deployment processes.

**SonarQube:** Focuses on code quality and security, conducting static code analysis and offering actionable insights to improve codebase health.

**AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry):** Serves as a secure and scalable container image registry for storing Docker images, ensuring reliable and efficient container deployments.

**Argo CD:** Manages Kubernetes resources and configurations using GitOps principles, ensuring consistency and reliability in container orchestration.

**AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):** Provides a managed Kubernetes environment for containerized applications, simplifying scaling and orchestration.

This DevOps project leverages these technologies to automate development workflows, enhance code quality, and efficiently manage containerized applications in a Kubernetes environment on AWS. It fosters rapid and reliable software delivery while maintaining security, scalability, and infrastructure consistency.
